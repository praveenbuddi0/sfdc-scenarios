In the provided Lightning Web Component (LWC) code, the pattern attribute in the <lightning-input> element is used to specify a regular expression pattern that the input value must match. This pattern is used for input validation.

Let's break down the pattern attribute in your code:

html

pattern="(^\([1-9]\d\)\s9?\d{5}-\d{4}$)"

Here's what each part of the pattern means:

    ^: Asserts the start of the string.
    \(: Matches an opening parenthesis "(".
    [1-9]: Matches a single digit from 1 to 9.
    \d: Matches any digit.
    \): Matches a closing parenthesis ")".
    \s: Matches any whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, and line breaks).
    9?: Matches an optional "9". The "?" means that the preceding character (in this case, "9") is optional.
    \d{5}: Matches exactly 5 digits.
    -: Matches a hyphen.
    \d{4}: Matches exactly 4 digits.
    $: Asserts the end of the string.

So, the overall pattern enforces a specific format for a phone number:

    The phone number must start with an opening parenthesis, followed by a digit from 1 to 9.
    It can have an optional "9" after the opening parenthesis.
    It must have exactly 5 digits, followed by a hyphen, and then exactly 4 more digits.
    The entire string must match this pattern from start to end.

If the user enters a value that does not conform to this pattern, the lightning-input element would be considered invalid, and the browser would prevent form submission until a valid value is provided. The onchange attribute is set to a function called handleMaskTelefone, indicating that this function will be invoked when the input value changes, possibly to handle masking or other logic related to the phone number input.
